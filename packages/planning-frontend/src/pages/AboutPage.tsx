        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          The Parent Planning Tool was created to help parents build
          personalized early learning plans grounded in state-specific
          standards. It is part of the Early Learning Standards project and
          shares the same standards database and authentication infrastructure.

          The Early Learning Standards Project
        </h3>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Early learning standards define what children should know and be able
          to do at various ages. Each state publishes its own set of standards,
          but they are often locked in PDFs and difficult for families to use.
          The Early Learning Standards project extracts, organizes, and verifies
          these standards into a searchable database — making them accessible to
          parents, educators, and tool builders alike.

          How the Planning Tool Fits In
        </h3>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          The Planning Tool sits on top of this standards database. When you
          create a plan, our AI assistant queries real indicators for your
          child's state and age, then generates activities that directly
          reference those standards. This means every suggestion in your plan is
          backed by the same benchmarks used by educators — not made up on the
          spot.
